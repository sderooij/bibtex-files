  abstract = {Machine learning leverages statistical and computer science principles to develop algorithms capable of improving performance through interpretation of data rather than through explicit instructions. Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre‐surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The success or failure of an epilepsy surgery depends greatly on the localization of epileptic focus (origin of a seizure). We address the problem of identification of a seizure origin through an analysis of ictal electroencephalogram (EEG), which is proven to be an effective standard in epileptic focus localization.Summary: With a goal of developing an automated and robust way of visual analysis of large amounts of EEG data, we propose a novel approach based on multiway models to study epilepsy seizure structure. Our contributions are 3-fold. First, we construct an Epilepsy Tensor with three modes, i.e. time samples, scales and electrodes, through wavelet analysis of multi-channel ictal EEG. Second, we demonstrate that multiway analysis techniques, in particular parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), provide promising results in modeling the complex structure of an epilepsy seizure, localizing a seizure origin and extracting artifacts. Third, we introduce an approach for removing artifacts using multilinear subspace analysis and discuss its merits and drawbacks.Results: Ictal EEG analysis of 10 seizures from 7 patients are included in this study. Our results for 8 seizures match with clinical observations in terms of seizure origin and extracted artifacts. On the other hand, for 2 of the seizures, seizure localization is not achieved using an initial trial of PARAFAC modeling. In these cases, first, we apply an artifact removal method and subsequently apply the PARAFAC model on the epilepsy tensor from which potential artifacts have been removed. This method successfully identifies the seizure origin in both cases.Contact:acare@cs.rpi.edu},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is an electrophysiological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research area for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identification of such subtle changes. Moreover, the EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, which contribute to further complexities related to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal (interictal and ictal) activities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to automatically identify the normal and abnormal activities using minimum number of highly discriminating features in classifiers. It has been found that nonlinear features are able to capture the complex physiological phenomena such as abrupt transitions and chaotic behavior in the EEG signals. In this review, we discuss various feature extraction methods and the results of different automated epilepsy stage detection techniques in detail. We also briefly present the various open ended challenges that need to be addressed before a CAD based epilepsy detection system can be set-up in a clinical setting.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, significant advances have been made on automated electroencephalogram (EEG)-based diagnosis of epilepsy and seizure detection. A number of innovative algorithms have been introduced that can aid in epilepsy diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. In recent years, the frontiers of computational epilepsy research have moved to seizure prediction, a more challenging problem. While antiepileptic medication can result in complete seizure freedom in many patients with epilepsy, up to one-third of patients living with epilepsy will have medically intractable epilepsy, where medications reduce seizure frequency but do not completely control seizures. If a seizure can be predicted prior to its clinical manifestation, then there is potential for abortive treatment to be given, either self-administered or via an implanted device administering medication or electrical stimulation. This will have a far-reaching impact on the treatment of epilepsy and patient's quality of life. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent efforts and journal articles on seizure prediction. The technologies developed for epilepsy diagnosis and seizure detection are being adapted and extended for seizure prediction. The paper ends with some novel ideas for seizure prediction using the increasingly ubiquitous machine learning technology, particularly deep neural network machine learning.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy, a neurological disorder, is characterized by the recurrence of seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are used to detect the presence of seizures, are non-linear and dynamic in nature. Visual inspection of the EEG signals for detection of normal, interictal, and ictal activities is a strenuous and time-consuming task due to the huge volumes of EEG segments that have to be studied. Therefore, non-linear methods are being widely used to study EEG signals for the automatic monitoring of epileptic activities. The aim of our work is to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique with minimal pre-processing steps that can classify all the three classes of EEG segments, namely normal, interictal, and ictal, using a small number of highly discriminating non-linear features in simple classifiers. To evaluate the technique, segments of normal, interictal, and ictal EEG segments (100 segments in each class) were used. Non-linear features based on the Higher Order Spectra (HOS), two entropies, namely the Approximation Entropy (ApEn) and the Sample Entropy (SampEn), and Fractal Dimension and Hurst Exponent were extracted from the segments. Significant features were selected using the ANOVA test. After evaluating the performance of six classifiers (Decision Tree, Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network) using a combination of the selected features, we found that using a set of all the selected six features in the Fuzzy classifier resulted in 99.7\% classification accuracy. We have demonstrated that our technique is capable of achieving high accuracy using a small number of features that accurately capture the subtle differences in the three different types of EEG (normal, interictal, and ictal) segments. The technique can be easily written as a software application and used by medical professionals without any extensive training and cost. Such software can evolve into an automatic seizure monitoring application in the near future and can aid the doctors in providing better and timely care for the patients suffering from epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the presence of recurring seizures. Like many other neurological disorders, epilepsy can be assessed by the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG signal is highly non-linear and non-stationary, and hence, it is difficult to characterize and interpret it. However, it is a well-established clinical technique with low associated costs. In this work, we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of normal, pre-ictal, and ictal conditions from recorded EEG signals. Four entropy features namely Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Phase Entropy 1 (S1), and Phase Entropy 2 (S2) were extracted from the collected EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Our results show that the Fuzzy classifier was able to differentiate the three classes with a high accuracy of 98.1\%. Overall, compared to previous techniques, our proposed strategy is more suitable for diagnosis of epilepsy with higher accuracy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However the success of SVM is very limited when it is applied to the problem of learning from imbalanced datasets in which negative instances heavily outnumber the positive instances (e.g. in gene profiling and detecting credit card fraud). This paper discusses the factors behind this failure and explains why the common strategy of undersampling the training data may not be the best choice for SVM. We then propose an algorithm for overcoming these problems which is based on a variant of the SMOTE algorithm by Chawla et al, combined with Veropoulos et al’s different error costs algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm against these two algorithms, along with undersampling and regular SVM and show that our algorithm outperforms all of them.},

  abstract = {Digital processing of electroencephalography (EEG) signals has now been popularly used in a wide variety of applications such as seizure detection/prediction, motor imagery classification, mental task classification, emotion classification, sleep state classification, and drug effects diagnosis. With the large number of EEG channels acquired, it has become apparent that efficient channel selection algorithms are needed with varying importance from one application to another. The main purpose of the channel selection process is threefold: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of any processing task performed on EEG signals by selecting the relevant channels and hence extracting the features of major importance, (ii) to reduce the amount of overfitting that may arise due to the utilization of unnecessary channels, for the purpose of improving the performance, and (iii) to reduce the setup time in some applications. Signal processing tools such as time-domain analysis, power spectral estimation, and wavelet transform have been used for feature extraction and hence for channel selection in most of channel selection algorithms. In addition, different evaluation approaches such as filtering, wrapper, embedded, hybrid, and human-based techniques have been widely used for the evaluation of the selected subset of channels. In this paper, we survey the recent developments in the field of EEG channel selection methods along with their applications and classify these methods according to the evaluation approach.},

  abstract = {Identifying a core set of features is one of the most important steps in the development of an automated seizure detector. In most of the published studies describing features and seizure classifiers, the features were hand-engineered, which may not be optimal. The main goal of the present paper is using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest to automatically optimize feature selection and classification. The input of the proposed classifier is raw multi-channel EEG and the output is the class label: seizure/nonseizure. By training this network, the required features are optimized, while fitting a nonlinear classifier on the features. After training the network with EEG recordings of 26 neonates, five end layers performing the classification were replaced with a random forest classifier in order to improve the performance. This resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.9 per hour and seizure detection rate of 77\% using a test set of EEG recordings of 22 neonates that also included dubious seizures. The newly proposed CNN classifier outperformed three data-driven feature-based approaches and performed similar to a previously developed heuristic method.},

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Since the manual detection of electrographic seizures in continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is very time-consuming and requires a trained expert, attempts to develop automatic seizure detection are diverse and ongoing. Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features, data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions, making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features – variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG signal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on wavelet coefficients – were able to significantly capture the seizures. When compared with a baseline method of classifying all epochs as normal, an improvement of 4.77–13.51\% in the Bayesian error was obtained.},

  abstract = {Recent research has investigated the possibility of predicting epileptic seizures. Intervention before the onset of seizure manifestations could be envisioned with accurate seizure forecasting. Although efforts for better prediction have been made, the translation of current approaches to clinical applications is still not possible. While early findings have been optimistic, the absence of statistical validation and reproducibility has raised doubts about the existence of a preictal state. Analysis and algorithmic studies are providing evidence that transition to the ictal state is not random, with build-up leading to seizures. We have reviewed the general framework of reliable algorithmic seizure prediction studies, discussing each component of the whole block diagram. We have explored steps along the pathway, from signal acquisition to adequate performance evaluation that should be taken into account in the design of an efficient seizure advisory/intervention system. The present review has established that there is potential for improvement and optimization in the seizure prediction framework. New databases, higher sampling frequencies, adequate preprocessing, electrode selection, and machine-learning considerations are all elements of the prediction scheme that should be assessed to achieve more realistic, better-than-chance performances.},

  abstract = {Real-life data often exhibit some structure and/or sparsity, allowing one to use parsimonious models for compact representation and approximation. When considering matrix and tensor data, low-rank models such as the (multilinear) singular value decomposition, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), tensor train, and hierarchical Tucker model are very common. The solution of (large-scale) linear systems is often structured in a similar way, allowing one to use compact matrix and tensor models as well. In this paper, we focus on linear systems with a CPD-constrained solution (LS-CPD). Our main contribution is the development of optimization-based and algebraic methods to solve LS-CPDs. Furthermore, we propose a condition that guarantees generic uniqueness of the obtained solution. We also show that LS-CPDs provide a broad framework for the analysis of multilinear systems of equations. The latter are a higher-order generalization of linear systems, similar to tensor decompositions being a generalization of matrix decompositions. The wide applicability of LS-CPDs in domains such as classification, multilinear algebra, and signal processing is illustrated.},

  abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.},

Traditional machine learning approaches are vector- or matrix-based, and cannot handle tensorial data directly. In this paper, we propose a tensor train (TT)-based kernel technique for the first time, and apply it to the conventional support vector machine (SVM) for high-dimensional image classification with very small number of training samples. Specifically, we propose a kernelized support tensor train machine that accepts tensorial input and preserves the intrinsic kernel property. The main contributions are threefold. First, we propose a TT-based feature mapping procedure that maintains the TT structure in the feature space. Second, we demonstrate two ways to construct the TT-based kernel function while considering consistency with the TT inner product and preservation of information. Third, we show that it is possible to apply different kernel functions on different data modes. In principle, our method tensorizes the standard SVM on its input structure and kernel mapping scheme. This reduces the storage and computation complexity of kernel matrix construction from exponential to polynomial. The validity proof and computation complexity of the proposed TT-based kernel functions are provided elaborately. Extensive experiments are performed on high-dimensional fMRI and color images datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with the state-of-the-art techniques.},

This problem is of paramount importance for the realization of monitoring/control units to be implanted on drug-resistant epileptic patients. The proposed solution relies in a novel way on autoregressive modeling of the EEG time series and combines a least-squares parameter estimator for EEG feature extraction along with a support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification between preictal/ictal and interictal states. This choice is characterized by low computational requirements compatible with a real-time implementation of the overall system. Moreover, experimental results on the Freiburg dataset exhibited correct prediction of all seizures (100 \% sensitivity) and, due to a novel regularization of the SVM classifier based on the Kalman filter, also a low false alarm rate.},

  abstract = {Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain–computer interfaces, BCI’s), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.},

  abstract = {Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a common and challenging problem in supervised learning as standard classification algorithms are designed to handle balanced class distributions. While different strategies exist to tackle this problem, methods which generate artificial data to achieve a balanced class distribution are more versatile than modifications to the classification algorithm. Such techniques, called oversamplers, modify the training data, allowing any classifier to be used with class-imbalanced datasets. Many algorithms have been proposed for this task, but most are complex and tend to generate unnecessary noise. This work presents a simple and effective oversampling method based on k-means clustering and SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique), which avoids the generation of noise and effectively overcomes imbalances between and within classes. Empirical results of extensive experiments with 90 datasets show that training data oversampled with the proposed method improves classification results. Moreover, k-means SMOTE consistently outperforms other popular oversampling methods. An implementation11The implementation of k-means SMOTE can be found at https://github.com/felix-last/kmeans\_smote. is made available in the Python programming language.},

We compare cross-validation (5-fold) with Xi-alpha, radius-margin bound, generalized approximate cross validation, maximum discrepancy and distance between two classes on 110 public binary data sets. Cross validation is the method that resulted in the best selection of the hyper-parameters, but it is also the method with one of the highest execution time. Distance between two classes (DBTC) is the fastest and the second best ranked method. We discuss that DBTC is a reasonable alternative to cross validation when training/hyperparameter-selection times are an issue and that the loss in accuracy when using DBTC is reasonably small.},

An HMP is a discrete-time finite-state homogeneous Markov chain observed through a discrete-time memoryless invariant channel. In recent years, the work of Baum and Petrie (1966) on finite-state finite-alphabet HMPs was expanded to HMPs with finite as well as continuous state spaces and a general alphabet. In particular, statistical properties and ergodic theorems for relative entropy densities of HMPs were developed. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimator were proved under some mild conditions. Similar results were established for switching autoregressive processes. These processes generalize HMPs. New algorithms were developed for estimating the state, parameter, and order of an HMP, for universal coding and classification of HMPs, and for universal decoding of hidden Markov channels. These and other related topics are reviewed.},

Methods: An initial bibliometric analysis shows that the reviewed papers focused on Electromyogram(EMG), Electroencephalogram(EEG), Electrocardiogram(ECG), and Electrooculogram(EOG). These four categories were used to structure the subsequent content review. Results: During the content review, we understood that deep learning performs better for big and varied datasets than classic analysis and machine classification methods. Deep learning algorithms try to develop the model by using all the available input.

The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some seizure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more transparent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes “focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.},

  abstract = {Classifier learning with data-sets that suffer from imbalanced class distributions is a challenging problem in data mining community. This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.},

A new supervised learning algorithm, dubbed Multi-SpikeProp, is developed for training MuSpiNN. The model and learning algorithm employ the heuristic rules and optimum parameter values presented by the authors in a recent paper that improved the efficiency of the original single-spiking Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model by two orders of magnitude. The classification accuracies of MuSpiNN and Multi-SpikeProp are evaluated using three increasingly more complicated problems: the XOR problem, the Fisher iris classification problem, and the epilepsy and seizure detection (EEG classification) problem. It is observed that MuSpiNN learns the XOR problem in twice the number of epochs compared with the single-spiking SNN model but requires only one-fourth the number of synapses. For the iris and EEG classification problems, a modular architecture is employed to reduce each 3-class classification problem to three 2-class classification problems and improve the classification accuracy. For the complicated EEG classification problem a classification accuracy in the range of 90.7\%–94.8\% was achieved, which is significantly higher than the 82\% classification accuracy obtained using the single-spiking SNN with SpikeProp.},

  abstract = {Identifying graph topologies as well as processes evolving over graphs emerge in various applications involving gene-regulatory, brain, power, and social networks, to name a few. Key graph-aware learning tasks include regression, classification, subspace clustering, anomaly identification, interpolation, extrapolation, and dimensionality reduction. Scalable approaches to deal with such high-dimensional tasks experience a paradigm shift to address the unique modeling and computational challenges associated with data-driven sciences. Albeit simple and tractable, linear time-invariant models are limited since they are incapable of handling generally evolving topologies, as well as nonlinear and dynamic dependencies between nodal processes. To this end, the main goal of this paper is to outline overarching advances, and develop a principled framework to capture nonlinearities through kernels, which are judiciously chosen from a preselected dictionary to optimally fit the data. The framework encompasses and leverages (non) linear counterparts of partial correlation and partial Granger causality, as well as (non)linear structural equations and vector autoregressions, along with attributes such as low rank, sparsity, and smoothness to capture even directional dependencies with abrupt change points, as well as time-evolving processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. The overarching approach inherits the versatility and generality of kernel-based methods, and lends itself to batch and computationally affordable online learning algorithms, which include novel Kalman filters over graphs. Real data experiments highlight the impact of the nonlinear and dynamic models on consumer and financial networks, as well as gene-regulatory and functional connectivity brain networks, where connectivity patterns revealed exhibit discernible differences relative to existing approaches.},

This process could be extensive, inefficient and time-consuming, especially for long term recordings. We proposed an automatic method to detect epileptic seizures using an imaged-EEG representation of brain signals. To accomplish this, we analyzed EEG signals from two different datasets: the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database and the EPILEPSIAE project that includes scalp and intracranial recordings. We used fully convolutional neural networks to automatically detect seizures. For our best model, we reached average accuracy and specificity values of 99.3\% and 99.6\%, respectively, for the CHB-MIT dataset, and corresponding values of 98.0\% and 98.3\% for the EPILEPSIAE patients. For these patients, the inclusion of intracranial electrodes together with scalp ones increased the average accuracy and specificity values to 99.6\% and 58.3\%, respectively. Regarding the other metrics, our best model reached average precision of 62.7\%, recall of 58.3\%, F-measure of 59.0\% and AP of 54.5\% on the CHB-MIT recordings, and comparatively lowers performances for the EPILEPSIAE dataset. For both databases, the number of false alarms per hour reached values less than 0.5/h for 92\% of the CHB-MIT patients and less than 1.0/h for 80\% of the EPILEPSIAE patients. Compared to recent studies, our lightweight approach does not need any estimation of pre-selected features and demonstrates high performances with promising possibilities for the introduction of such automatic methods in the clinical practice.},

The algorithm was evaluated using a large data-set containing ECG and multi-channel EEG of realistic duration and quality. Significance Analysis of simultaneously-recorded EEG and ECG represents a new approach in seizure detection research and the detection performance of the proposed system is a significant improvement on previous reported results for automated neonatal seizure detection.},

  abstract = {Objective This study was undertaken to identify the best performing quantitative EEG features for neonatal seizures detection from a test set of 21. Methods Each feature was evaluated on 1-min, artefact-free segments of seizure and non-seizure neonatal EEG recordings. The potential utility of each feature for neonatal seizure detection was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis and repeated measures t-tests. A performance estimate of the feature set was obtained using a cross-fold validation and combining all features together into a linear discriminant classifier model. Results Significant differences between seizure and non-seizure segments were found in 19 features for 17 patients. The best performing features for this application were the RMS amplitude, the line length and the number of local maxima and minima. An estimate of the patient independent classifier performance yielded a sensitivity of 81.08\% and specificity of 82.23\%. Conclusions The individual performances of 21 quantitative EEG features in detecting electrographic seizure in the neonate were compared and numerically quantified. Combining all features together into a classifier model led to superior performance than that provided by any individual feature taken alone. Significance The results documented in this study may provide a reference for the optimum quantitative EEG features to use in developing and enhancing neonatal seizure detection algorithms.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the support vector machines (SVMs) have been very successful in remote sensing image classification, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data and limited training samples. Nevertheless, the vector-based feature alignment of the SVM can lead to an information loss in representation of hyperspectral images, which intrinsically have a tensor-based data structure. In this paper, a new multiclass support tensor machine (STM) is specifically developed for hyperspectral image classification. Our newly proposed STM processes the hyperspectral image as a data cube and then identifies the information classes in tensor space. The multiclass STM is developed from a set of binary STM classifiers using the one-against-one parallel strategy. As a part of our tensor-based processing chain, a multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) is used for preprocessing, in order to reduce the tensorial data redundancy and, at the same time, preserve the tensorial structure information in sparse and high-order subspaces. As a result, the contributions of this work are twofold: a new multiclass STM model for hyperspectral image classification is developed, and a tensorial image interpretation framework is constructed, which provides a system consisting of tensor-based feature representation, feature extraction, and classification. Experiments with four hyperspectral data sets, covering agricultural and urban areas, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the proposed STM and MPCA-STM can achieve better results than traditional SVM-based classifiers.},

Detecting rare events can be viewed as a prediction task in data mining and machine learning communities. As these events are rarely observed in daily life, the prediction task suffers from a lack of balanced data. In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.},

At present, most of the existing learning machines, such as support tensor machine (STM), involve nonconvex optimization problems and need to resort to iterative techniques. Obviously, it is very time-consuming and may suffer from local minima. In order to overcome these two shortcomings, in this paper, we present a novel linear support higher-order tensor machine (SHTM) which integrates the merits of linear C-support vector machine (C-SVM) and tensor rank-one decomposition. Theoretically, SHTM is an extension of the linear C-SVM to tensor patterns. When the input patterns are vectors, SHTM degenerates into the standard C-SVM. A set of experiments is conducted on nine second-order face recognition datasets and three third-order gait recognition datasets to illustrate the performance of the proposed SHTM. The statistic test shows that compared with STM and C-SVM with the RBF kernel, SHTM provides significant performance gain in terms of test accuracy and training speed, especially in the case of higher-order tensors.},

  abstract = {The fault diagnosis methods of rotating machinery based on machine learning have been developed in the past years, such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). SVM just can be only used for the classification of the vector space in which the feature data extracted from raw signals are input data in vector form, so SVM loses its functions while the input feature data are high order tensors which can contain rich feature information of rotating machinery. Moreover, a large number of data are needed in CNN, but it’s hard to get large numbers of fault samples of rotating machinery under different conditions. Recently, a kind of tensor classifier called support tensor machines (STM) can solve the problems in the above methods. But when the input samples of STM are unbalanced data, the hyper-plane obtained by the training of STM may not be the optimal hyper-plane and it may reduce the overall classification rate. Therefore, in this paper, a novel tensor classifier called support tensor machine with dynamic penalty factors (DC-STM) is proposed and applied to the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. In this method, for linear separable case, linear support tensor model with dynamic penalty factors (DC-LSTM) is proposed, which does not ignore the impact of rare support vectors of a class with less training samples on the structural risk. Subsequently, for nonlinear separable case, a tensor kernel function is introduced into DC-LSTM, and nonlinear support tensor model with dynamic penalty factors (DC-NSTM) is proposed. In order to verify the performance of DC-STM in unbalanced data classification, it is applied to fault classification of rotating machinery with unbalanced data. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better classification results when the training samples of rotating machinery are unbalanced data.},

  abstract = {Recent achievements in the field of tensor product approximation provide promising new formats for the representation of tensors in form of tree tensor networks. In contrast to the canonical r-term representation (CANDECOMP, PARAFAC), these new formats provide stable representations, while the amount of required data is only slightly larger. The tensor train (TT) format [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 33 (2011), pp. 2295–2317], a simple special case of the hierarchical Tucker format [J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 5 (2009), p. 706], is a useful prototype for practical low-rank tensor representation. In this article, we show how optimization tasks can be treated in the TT format by a generalization of the well-known alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and by a modified approach (MALS) that enables dynamical rank adaptation. A formulation of the component equations in terms of so-called retraction operators helps to show that many structural properties of the original problems transfer to the micro-iterations, giving what is to our knowledge the first stable generic algorithm for the treatment of optimization tasks in the tensor format. For the examples of linear equations and eigenvalue equations, we derive concrete working equations for the micro-iteration steps; numerical examples confirm the theoretical results concerning the stability of the TT decomposition and of ALS and MALS but also show that in some cases, high TT ranks are required during the iterative approximation of low-rank tensors, showing some potential of improvement.},

  abstract = {Recognition of epileptic seizures from offline EEG signals is very important in clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Compared with manual labeling of EEG signals by doctors, machine learning approaches can be faster and more consistent. However, the classification accuracy is usually not satisfactory for two main reasons: the distributions of the data used for training and testing may be different, and the amount of training data may not be enough. In addition, most machine learning approaches generate black-box models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we integrate transductive transfer learning, semisupervised learning and TSK fuzzy system to tackle these three problems. More specifically, we use transfer learning to reduce the discrepancy in data distribution between the training and testing data, employ semi-supervised learning to use the unlabeled testing data to remedy the shortage of training data, and adopt TSK fuzzy system to increase model interpretability. Two learning algorithms are proposed to train the system. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance than many state-of-the-art seizure classification algorithms.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize knowledge from quantitative and qualitative clinical researches using wearable sensors in epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and stroke. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus spanning from 1995 to January 2017. A synthesis of the main findings, reported adherence to wearables and missing data from quantitative studies, is provided. Clinimetric properties of measures derived from wearables in laboratory, free activities in hospital, and free-living environment were also evaluated. Qualitative thematic synthesis was conducted to explore user experiences and acceptance of wearables. Results\hspace{0.6em} In total, 56 studies (50 reporting quantitative and 6 reporting qualitative data) were included for data extraction and synthesis. Among studies reporting quantitative data, 5 were in epilepsy, 21 PD, and 24 studies in stroke. In epilepsy, wearables are used to detect and differentiate seizures in hospital settings. In PD, the focus is on quantification of cardinal motor symptoms and medication-evoked adverse symptoms in both laboratory and free-living environment. In stroke upper extremity activity, walking and physical activity have been studied in laboratory and during free activities. Three analytic themes emerged from thematic synthesis of studies reporting qualitative data: acceptable integration in daily life, lack of confidence in technology, and the need to consider individualization. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Wearables may provide information of clinical features of interest in epilepsy, PD and stroke, but knowledge regarding the clinical utility for supporting clinical decision making remains to be established.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper investigates the hypothesis that focal seizures can be predicted using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our first aim is to learn features that distinguish between the interictal and preictal regions. The second aim is to define a prediction horizon in which the prediction is as accurate and as early as possible, clearly two competing objectives. Methods: Convolutional filters on the wavelet transformation of the EEG signal are used to define and learn quantitative signatures for each period: interictal, preictal, and ictal. The optimal seizure prediction horizon is also learned from the data as opposed to making an a priori assumption. Results: Computational solutions to the optimization problem indicate a 10-min seizure prediction horizon. This result is verified by measuring Kullback-Leibler divergence on the distributions of the automatically extracted features. Conclusion: The results on the EEG database of 204 recordings demonstrate that (i) the preictal phase transition occurs approximately ten minutes before seizure onset, and (ii) the prediction results on the test set are promising, with a sensitivity of 87.8\% and a low false prediction rate of 0.142 FP/h. Our results significantly outperform a random predictor and other seizure prediction algorithms. Significance: We demonstrate that a robust set of features can be learned from scalp EEG that characterize the preictal state of focal seizures.},

The corresponding optimization problem is solved in an iterative manner utilizing the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, where at each iteration the parameters corresponding to the projections along a single tensor mode are estimated by solving a typical Support Vector Machine (SVM)-type optimization problem. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated on the problems of gait and action recognition where we report results that improve, in some cases considerably, the state of the art.},

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision.

Our method was evaluated on 525~h of data, including 88 seizures in 21 patients. The individual performances of the three features used by Saab and Gotman were compared to six alternative features, and combinations of these nine features were analyzed in order to find a superior detector. On a testing set with the combination of their three features, Saab and Gotman reported a sensitivity of 0.78, a false positive rate of 0.86/h, and a median detection delay of 9.8~s. Based on 10-fold cross-validation the testing performance of our implementation of their method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79, a false positive rate of 0.62/h, and a median detection delay of 21.3~s. A detector based on an alternative combination of features achieved sensitivity of 0.81, a false positive rate of 0.60/h, and a median detection delay of 16.9~s. By including filtering techniques, it was possible to achieve performance levels similar to Saab and Gotman using our implementation of their method, although this involved increases in detection delays. Of the seizure detection measures investigated, relative average amplitude, relative power, relative derivative, and coefficent of variation of amplitude provided the best performing combinations. These better-performing features can be employed together to make robust and reliable seizure detectors.},

The discriminative performance of 65 previously reported features has been evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, area under the sensitivity–specificity curve (AUC), and relative computational complexity, on 47 seizures (split in 2,698 2~s sections) in over 172~h of scalp EEG from 24 adults. The best performing features are line length and relative power in the 12.5–25~Hz band. Relative power has a better seizure detection performance (AUC~=~0.83; line length AUC~=~0.77), but is calculated after the discrete wavelet transform and is thus more computationally complex. Hence, relative power achieves the best performance for offline detection, whilst line length would be preferable for online low complexity detection. These results, from the largest systematic study of seizure detection features, aid future researchers in selecting an optimal set of features when designing algorithms for both standard offline detection and new online low computational complexity detectors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH: We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. MAIN RESULTS: We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

  abstract = {Least squares support vector machines are a commonly used supervised learning method for nonlinear regression and classification. They can be implemented in either their primal or dual form. The latter requires solving a linear system, which can be advantageous as an explicit mapping of the data to a possibly infinite-dimensional feature space is avoided. However, for large-scale applications, current low-rank approximation methods can perform inadequately. For example, current methods are probabilistic due to their sampling procedures, and/or suffer from a poor trade-off between the ranks and approximation power. In this paper, a recursive Bayesian filtering framework based on tensor networks and the Kalman filter is presented to alleviate the demanding memory and computational complexities associated with solving large-scale dual problems. The proposed method is iterative, does not require explicit storage of the kernel matrix, and allows the formulation of early stopping conditions. Additionally, the framework yields confidence estimates of obtained models, unlike alternative methods. The performance is tested on two regression and three classification experiments, and compared to the Nystr\textbackslash "om and fixed size LS-SVM methods. Results show that our method can achieve high performance and is particularly useful when alternative methods are computationally infeasible due to a slowly decaying kernel matrix spectrum.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an important role in recording brain activity to diagnose epilepsy. However, it is not only laborious, but also not very cost effective for medical experts to manually identify the features on EEG. Therefore, automatic seizure detection in accordance with the EEG recordings is significant for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Here, a new method for detecting seizures using tensor distance (TD) is proposed. First, the time–frequency characteristics of EEG signals are obtained by wavelet transformation, and the tensor representation of EEG signals is then obtained. Tucker decomposition is used to obtain the principal components of the EEG tensor. After, the distances between different categories of EEG tensors are calculated as the EEG features. Finally, the TD features are classified through the Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (Bayesian LDA) classifier. The performance of this method is measured by the sensitivity, specificity, and recognition accuracy. Results indicate 95.12\% sensitivity, 97.60\% specificity, 97.60\% recognition accuracy, and a false detection rate of 0.76 per hour in the invasive EEG dataset, which included 566.57 h of EEG recording data from 21 patients. Taken together, the results show that TD has a good detection effect for seizure classification and that this method has high computational speed and great potential for real-time diagnosis.},

Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system suggest that prior to a seizure, recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing down, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy forecasting has been extensively studied using high-order time series obtained from scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). An accurate seizure prediction system would not only help significantly improve patients’ quality of life, but would also facilitate new therapeutic strategies to manage epilepsy. This paper thus proposes an improved Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm to mine seizure forecasts from neural activity by modeling three properties in the high-order EEG time series: noise, temporal smoothness, and tensor structure. The proposed High-Order Kalman Filter (HOKF) is an extension of the standard Kalman filter, for which higher-order modeling is limited. The efficient dynamic of HOKF system preserves the tensor structure of the observations and latent states. As such, the proposed method offers two main advantages: (i) effectiveness with HOKF results in hidden variables that capture major evolving trends suitable to predict neural activity, even in the presence of missing values; and (ii) scalability in that the wall clock time of the HOKF is linear with respect to the number of time-slices of the sequence. The HOKF algorithm is examined in terms of its effectiveness and scalability by conducting forecasting and scalability experiments with a real epilepsy EEG dataset. The results of the simulation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the original Kalman Filter and other existing methods.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of epileptic seizures can serve as a valuable clinical tool which involves a more objective and computationally efficient method for the analysis of EEG data in order to generate increasingly accurate and reliable results. Automatic seizure detection is also an important component of closed-loop responsive cortical stimulation systems. The goal of this study is to evaluate EEG-based features recently proposed for seizure detection to discover the optimum ones for a reliable seizure detection system. We extracted seizure detection features from intracranial EEG signals that were recorded during invasive pre-surgical epilepsy monitoring of people with drug resistant focal epilepsy at the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg. Features from time, frequency and phase space domains as well as similarity/dissimilarity features were considered. The performance of each feature was investigated using the statistical test ANOVA. Performance analysis was conducted separately on the recordings from the channels within the seizure-onset zone (SOZ-in) and the recordings from the channels outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ-out). Similarity/dissimilarity features that measure dynamic properties of the EEG signal and the evolving phenomena of the seizures could significantly separate ictal (during seizure) states from pre-ictal (before seizure) states (p {$<$} 0.01). Among them, our proposed feature, Bhattacharyya-based dissimilarity index (BBDI), successfully passed Tukey's post-hoc test as well suggesting that it can distinguish both pre-ictal and post-ictal (after seizure) periods from ictal period. BBDI was further applied to detect epileptic seizures and achieved area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) equal to 0.96 and 0.94 for SOZ-in and SOZ-out channels, respectively. No significant difference (p = 0.59) was observed in the performance of features between SOZ-in recordings and SOZ-out recordings. The discriminative value of EEG seizure detection features was determined by statistical tests. As a result, the best features to be selected for a reliable seizure detection system designed for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were suggested, which include similarity/dissimilarity indices.},

Methods: Advanced digital signal processing techniques used in time-frequency localization, image processing, and identification of time-varying stochastic systems were used to develop the algorithm, which operates in generic or adaptable “modes.” The “generic mode” was tested on (a) 125 partial seizures (each contained in a 10-min segment) involving the mesial temporal regions and recorded using depth electrodes from 16 subjects, and (b) 205 ten-minute segments of randomly selected interictal (nonseizure) data. The performance of the algorithm was compared with expert visual analysis, the current “gold standard.” Results: The generic algorithm achieved perfect sensitivity and specificity (no false-positive and no false-negative detections) over the entire data set. Seizure intensity, a novel measure that seems clinically relevant, ranged between 35.7 and 6129. Detection was sufficiently rapid to allow prediction of clinical onset in 92\% of seizures by a mean of 15.5 s. Conclusions: This algorithm, which was implemented with a personal computer, represents a definitive step toward rapid and accurate detection and prediction of seizures. It may also enable development of intelligent devices for automated seizure warning and treatment and stimulate new study of the dynamics of seizures and of the epileptic brain.},

  abstract = {Purpose: We propose a patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction using multiple features of spectral power from electroencephalogram (EEG) and support vector machine (SVM) classification. Methods: The proposed patient-specific algorithm consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, SVM classification, and postprocessing. Preprocessing removes artifacts of intracranial EEG recordings and they are further preprocessed in bipolar and/or time-differential methods. Features of spectral power of raw, or bipolar and/or time-differential intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in nine bands are extracted from a sliding 20-s–long and half-overlapped window. Nine bands are selected based on standard EEG frequency bands, but the wide gamma bands are split into four. Cost-sensitive SVMs are used for classification of preictal and interictal samples, and double cross-validation is used to achieve in-sample optimization and out-of-sample testing. We postprocess SVM classification outputs using the Kalman Filter and it removes sporadic and isolated false alarms. The algorithm has been tested on iEEG of 18 patients of 20 available in the Freiburg EEG database who had three or more seizure events. To investigate the discriminability of the features between preictal and interictal, we use the Kernel Fisher Discriminant analysis. Key findings: The proposed patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction has achieved high sensitivity of 97.5\% with total 80 seizure events and a low false alarm rate of 0.27 per hour and total false prediction times of 13.0\% over a total of 433.2 interictal hours by bipolar preprocessing (92.5\% sensitivity, a false positive rate of 0.20 per hour, and false prediction times of 9.5\% by time-differential preprocessing). This high prediction rate demonstrates that seizures can be predicted by the patient-specific approach using linear features of spectral power and nonlinear classifiers. Bipolar and/or time-differential preprocessing significantly improves sensitivity and specificity. Spectral powers in high gamma bands are the most discriminating features between preictal and interictal. Significance: High sensitivity and specificity are achieved by nonlinear classification of linear features of spectral power. Power changes in certain frequency bands already demonstrated their possibilities for seizure prediction indicators, but we have demonstrated that combining those spectral power features and classifying them in a multivariate approach led to much higher prediction rates. Employing only linear features is advantageous, especially when it comes to an implantable device, because they can be computed rapidly with low power consumption.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) recently stated that epilepsy affects nearly 65 million people of the world population. Early forecast of the oncoming seizures is of paramount importance in saving the life of epileptic patients. This paper demonstrates a phase transition-based seizure prediction approach from multi-channel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The primary focus of this work is to discriminate the seizure and seizure-free EEG signals by learning the dynamics of preictal, interictal and ictal period. We propose an adaptive optimization approach using non-linear conjugate gradient technique in conjunction with Sparsity based EEG Reconstruction (SER) and three-dimensional Optimized Convolutional Neural Network (3D OCNN) classifier, based on Fletcher Reeves (FR) algorithm. Sparsity based artifact removal approach along with a 3D OCNN classifier, classifies the various states of seizures. FR algorithm is deployed with the deep neural network architecture to accelerate the convergence rate and to reduce the complexity of the proposed non-linear model. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm replacing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in the K-SVD algorithm, further reduces the time and complexity of the pre-processing stage. We further propose a Phase Transition based Kullback-Leibler divergence (PTB-KL) predictor for obtaining the Optimal Seizure Prediction Horizon (OSPH). The proposed model is evaluated using three diverse databases such as CHB-MIT, NINC and SRM respectively. Empirical results on the three EEG databases of 300 recordings outperforms the state-of-art approaches with an accuracy score of 0.98, sensitivity score of 0.99 and False Prediction Rate (FPR) of 0.07 FP/h. Statistical assessment of the proposed predictor gains an OSPH of about 1.1~h prior to the seizure onset. Experimental results prove that the phase transition-based seizure prediction approach is a promising one for accurate real-time prediction of epilepsy using scalp EEG data.},

The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

Our method scales gracefully from regimes where little training data is available to regimes where data from large collection of time series can be leveraged to learn accurate models.

  abstract = {There have been different efforts to predict epileptic seizures and most of them are based on the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, recent publications have suggested that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new technique, could be used to predict seizures. The objectives of this research are to show that the application of fNIRS to epileptic seizure detection yields results that are superior to those based on EEG and to demonstrate that the application of deep learning to this problem is suitable given the nature of fNIRS recordings. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to the prediction of epileptic seizures from fNIRS signals, an optical modality for recording brain waves. The implementation of the proposed method is presented in this work. Application of CNN to fNIRS recordings showed an accuracy ranging between 96.9\% and 100\%, sensitivity between 95.24\% and 100\%, specificity between 98.57\% and 100\%, a positive predictive value between 98.52\% and 100\%, and a negative predictive value between 95.39\% and 100\%. The most important aspect of this research is the combination of fNIRS signals with the particular CNN algorithm. The fNIRS modality has not been used in epileptic seizure prediction. A CNN is suitable for this application because fNIRS recordings are high dimensional data and they can be modeled as three-dimensional tensors for classification.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of epileptic seizures is still a challenging problem due to the intolerance of EEG. Introducing ECG can help with EEG for detecting seizures. However, the existing methods depended on fusing either the extracted features or the classification results of EEG-only and ECG-only with ignoring the interaction between them, so the detection rate did not improve much. Also, all EEG channels were considered in a complex manner. Moreover, the detection of epilepsy firing location, which is an important issue for diagnosing epilepsy, is not considered before. Therefore, we propose a new method based on the brain-heart interaction (BHI) for detecting the seizure onset and its firing location in the brain with lower complexity and better performance. BHI allows us to study the nonlinear coupling and variation of phase-synchronization between brain regions and heart activity, which are effective for distinguishing seizures. In our method, the EEG channels are mapped into two surrogate channels to reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, the firing location detector is triggered only once the seizure is detected to save the system’s power. Evaluation using different proposed classification networks based on the TUSZ, the largest available EEG/ECG dataset with 315 subjects and 7 seizure types, showed that our BHI method improves the sensitivity by 48\% with only 4 false alarms/24h compared to using only EEG. Moreover, it outperforms the performance of the average human detector based on the quantitative EEG tools by achieving a sensitivity of 68.2\% with 11.9 false alarms/ 24h and a latency of 11.94 sec.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

  abstract = {Standardized EEG electrode positions are essential for both clinical applications and research. The aim of this guideline is to update and expand the unifying nomenclature and standardized positioning for EEG scalp electrodes. Electrode positions were based on 20\% and 10\% of standardized measurements from anatomical landmarks on the skull. However, standard recordings do not cover the anterior and basal temporal lobes, which is the most frequent source of epileptogenic activity. Here, we propose a basic array of 25 electrodes including the inferior temporal chain, which should be used for all standard clinical recordings. The nomenclature in the basic array is consistent with the 10–10-system. High-density scalp EEG arrays (64–256 electrodes) allow source imaging with even sub-lobar precision. This supplementary exam should be requested whenever necessary, e.g. search for epileptogenic activity in negative standard EEG or for presurgical evaluation. In the near future, nomenclature for high density electrodes arrays beyond the 10–10 system needs to be defined, to allow comparison and standardized recordings across centers. Contrary to the established belief that smaller heads needs less electrodes, in young children at least as many electrodes as in adults should be applied due to smaller skull thickness and the risk of spatial aliasing.

  abstract = {Tensor-based techniques for learning allow one to exploit the structure of carefully chosen representations of data. This is a desirable feature in particular when the number of training patterns is small which is often the case in areas such as biosignal processing and chemometrics. However, the class of tensor-based models is somewhat restricted and might suffer from limited discriminative power. On a different track, kernel methods lead to flexible nonlinear models that have been proven successful in many different contexts. Nonetheless, a naïve application of kernel methods does not exploit structural properties possessed by the given tensorial representations. The goal of this work is to go beyond this limitation by introducing non-parametric tensor-based models. The proposed framework aims at improving the discriminative power of supervised tensor-based models while still exploiting the structural information embodied in the data. We begin by introducing a feature space formed by multilinear functionals. The latter can be considered as the infinite dimensional analogue of tensors. Successively we show how to implicitly map input patterns in such a feature space by means of kernels that exploit the algebraic structure of data tensors. The proposed tensorial kernel links to the MLSVD and features an interesting invariance property; the approach leads to convex optimization and fits into the same primal–dual framework underlying SVM-like algorithms.},

  abstract = {Real-time continuous tracking of seizure state is necessary to develop feedback neuromodulation therapy that can prevent or terminate a seizure early. Due to its high temporal resolution, high scalp coverage, and non-invasive applicability, electroencephalography (EEG) is a good candidate for seizure tracking. In this research, we make multiple seizure state estimations using a mixed-filter and multiple channels found over the entire sensor space; then by applying a Kalman filter, we produce a single seizure state estimation made up of these individual estimations. Using a modified wrapper feature selection, we determine two optimal features of mixed data type, one continuous and one binary analyzing all available channels. These features are used in a state-space framework to model the continuous hidden seizure state. Expectation maximization is performed offline on the training and validation data sets to estimate unknown parameters. The seizure state estimation process is performed for multiple channels, and the seizure state estimation is derived using a square-root Kalman filter. A second expectation maximization step is utilized to estimate the unknown square-root Kalman filter parameters. This method is tested in a real-time applicable way for seizure state estimation. Applying this approach, we obtain a single seizure state estimation with quantitative information about the likelihood of a seizure occurring, which we call seizure probability. Our results on the experimental data (CHB-MIT EEG database) validate the proposed estimation method and we achieve an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92.7\%, 92.8\%, and 93.4\%, respectively. The potential applications of this seizure estimation model are for closed-loop neuromodulation and long-term quantitative analysis of seizure treatment efficacy.},

  abstract = {Mixture of experts (ME) is modular neural network architecture for supervised learning. A double-loop Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been introduced to the ME network structure for detection of epileptic seizure. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then these sub-band frequencies were used as an input to a ME network with two discrete outputs: normal and epileptic. In order to improve accuracy, the outputs of expert networks were combined according to a set of local weights called the “gating function”. The invariant transformations of the ME probability density functions include the permutations of the expert labels and the translations of the parameters in the gating functions. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated in terms of classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ME network structure has some potential in detecting epileptic seizures. The ME network structure achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network model.},

  abstract = {In this work, we proposed a versatile signal processing and analysis framework for Electroencephalogram (EEG). Within this framework the signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using DWT and a set of statistical features was extracted from the sub-bands to represent the distribution of wavelet coefficients. Principal components analysis (PCA), independent components analysis (ICA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimension of data. Then these features were used as an input to a support vector machine (SVM) with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or not. The performance of classification process due to different methods is presented and compared to show the excellent of classification process. These findings are presented as an example of a method for training, and testing a seizure prediction method on data from individual petit mal epileptic patients. Given the heterogeneity of epilepsy, it is likely that methods of this type will be required to configure intelligent devices for treating epilepsy to each individual’s neurophysiology prior to clinical operation.},

  abstract = {Tensor representation is helpful to reduce the small sample size problem in discriminative subspace selection. As pointed by this paper, this is mainly because the structure information of objects in computer vision research is a reasonable constraint to reduce the number of unknown parameters used to represent a learning model. Therefore, we apply this information to the vector-based learning and generalize the vector-based learning to the tensor-based learning as the supervised tensor learning (STL) framework, which accepts tensors as input. To obtain the solution of STL, the alternating projection optimization procedure is developed. The STL framework is a combination of the convex optimization and the operations in multilinear algebra. The tensor representation helps reduce the overfitting problem in vector-based learning. Based on STL and its alternating projection optimization procedure, we generalize support vector machines, minimax probability machine, Fisher discriminant analysis, and distance metric learning, to support tensor machines, tensor minimax probability machine, tensor Fisher discriminant analysis, and the multiple distance metrics learning, respectively. We also study the iterative procedure for feature extraction within STL. To examine the effectiveness of STL, we implement the tensor minimax probability machine for image classification. By comparing with minimax probability machine, the tensor version reduces the overfitting problem.},

  abstract = {The Commission on Classification and Terminology and the Commission on Epidemiology of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) have charged a Task Force to revise concepts, definition, and classification of status epilepticus (SE). The proposed new definition of SE is as follows: Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which lead to abnormally, prolonged seizures (after time point t1). It is a condition, which can have long-term consequences (after time point t2), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures. This definition is conceptual, with two operational dimensions: the first is the length of the seizure and the time point (t1) beyond which the seizure should be regarded as “continuous seizure activity.” The second time point (t2) is the time of ongoing seizure activity after which there is a risk of long-term consequences. In the case of convulsive (tonic–clonic) SE, both time points (t1 at 5 min and t2 at 30 min) are based on animal experiments and clinical research. This evidence is incomplete, and there is furthermore considerable variation, so these time points should be considered as the best estimates currently available. Data are not yet available for other forms of SE, but as knowledge and understanding increase, time points can be defined for specific forms of SE based on scientific evidence and incorporated into the definition, without changing the underlying concepts. A new diagnostic classification system of SE is proposed, which will provide a framework for clinical diagnosis, investigation, and therapeutic approaches for each patient. There are four axes: (1) semiology; (2) etiology; (3) electroencephalography (EEG) correlates; and (4) age. Axis 1 (semiology) lists different forms of SE divided into those with prominent motor systems, those without prominent motor systems, and currently indeterminate conditions (such as acute confusional states with epileptiform EEG patterns). Axis 2 (etiology) is divided into subcategories of known and unknown causes. Axis 3 (EEG correlates) adopts the latest recommendations by consensus panels to use the following descriptors for the EEG: name of pattern, morphology, location, time-related features, modulation, and effect of intervention. Finally, axis 4 divides age groups into neonatal, infancy, childhood, adolescent and adulthood, and elderly.},

In this work, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced in epileptic seizure prediction using EEG signals, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). A pre-analysis is initially performed to find the optimal architecture of the LSTM network by testing several modules and layers of memory units. Based on these results, a two-layer LSTM network is selected to evaluate seizure prediction performance using four different lengths of preictal windows, ranging from 15\,min to 2\,h. The LSTM model exploits a wide range of features extracted prior to classification, including time and frequency domain features, between EEG channels cross-correlation and graph theoretic features. The evaluation is performed using long-term EEG recordings from the open CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, suggest that the proposed methodology is able to predict all 185 seizures, providing high rates of seizure prediction sensitivity and low false prediction rates (FPR) of 0.11–0.02 false alarms per hour, depending on the duration of the preictal window. The proposed LSTM-based methodology delivers a significant increase in seizure prediction performance compared to both traditional machine learning techniques and convolutional neural networks that have been previously evaluated in the literature.},

However, existing techniques are too limited to measure all but a small fraction of the physical variables and parameters of neuronal networks. We constructed models of the biophysical properties of neuronal membrane, synaptic, and microenvironment dynamics, and incorporated them into a model-based predictor-controller framework from modern control theory. We demonstrate that it is now possible to meaningfully estimate the dynamics of small neuronal networks using as few as a single measured variable. Specifically, we assimilate noisy membrane potential measurements from individual hippocampal neurons to reconstruct the dynamics of networks of these cells, their extracellular microenvironment, and the activities of different neuronal types during seizures. We use reconstruction to account for unmeasured parts of the neuronal system, relating micro-domain metabolic processes to cellular excitability, and validate the reconstruction of cellular dynamical interactions against actual measurements. Data assimilation, the fusing of measurement with computational models, has significant potential to improve the way we observe and understand brain dynamics.},

Although this endeavor is well-established, existing solutions are typically restricted to lab or hospital conditions because they operate on recordings from a set of EEG electrodes that covers the whole head. By contrast, a true breakthrough for these applications would be the deployment `in the real world', by means of wearable devices that encompass just one (or a few) channels. Such a reduction of the available information inevitably makes the classification task more challenging. We tackle this issue by means of a multilinear subspace learning step (using data from multiple channels during training) and subsequently solving a regression problem with a low-rank structure to classify new trials (using data from only a single channel during testing). We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on EEG data recorded during a mental arithmetic task.},

  abstract = {Early detection of arrhythmia and effective treatment can prevent deaths caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD). In clinical practice, the diagnosis is made by checking the electrocardiogram (ECG) beat-by-beat, but this is usually time-consuming and laborious. In the paper, we propose an automatic ECG classification method based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CWT is used to decompose ECG signals to obtain different time-frequency components, and CNN is used to extract features from the 2D-scalogram composed of the above time-frequency components. Considering the surrounding R peak interval (also called RR interval) is also useful for the diagnosis of arrhythmia, four RR interval features are extracted and combined with the CNN features to input into a fully connected layer for ECG classification. By testing in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our method achieves an overall performance of 70.75\%, 67.47\%, 68.76\%, and 98.74\% for positive predictive value, sensitivity, F1-score, and accuracy, respectively. Compared with existing methods, the overall F1-score of our method is increased by 4.75\textasciitilde 16.85\%. Because our method is simple and highly accurate, it can potentially be used as a clinical auxiliary diagnostic tool.},

Their slow Monte Carlo convergence rate has motivated the research of deterministic Fourier features whose approximation error can decrease exponentially in the number of basis functions. However, due to their tensor product extension to multiple dimensions, these methods suffer heavily from the curse of dimensionality, limiting their applicability to one, two or threedimensional scenarios. In our approach we overcome said curse of dimensionality by exploiting the tensor product structure of deterministic Fourier features, which enables us to represent the model parameters as a low-rank tensor decomposition. We derive a monotonically converging block coordinate descent algorithm with linear complexity in both the sample size and the dimensionality of the inputs for a regularized squared loss function, allowing to learn a parsimonious model in decomposed form using deterministic Fourier features. We demonstrate by means of numerical experiments how our low-rank tensor approach obtains the same performance of the corresponding nonparametric model, consistently outperforming random Fourier features.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to forecast seizures with varying success. There is an increasing interest to use electrocardiogram (ECG) to help with seizure forecasting. The neural and cardiovascular systems may exhibit critical slowing, which is measured by an increase in variance and autocorrelation of the system, when change from a normal state to an ictal state. To forecast seizures, the variance and autocorrelation of long-term continuous EEG and ECG data from 16 patients were used for analysis. The average period of recordings was 161.9 h, with an average of 9 electrographic seizures in an individual patient. The relationship between seizure onset times and phases of variance and autocorrelation in EEG and ECG data was investigated. The results of forecasting models using critical slowing features, seizure circadian features, and combined critical slowing and circadian features were compared using the receiver-operating characteristic curve. The results demonstrated that the best forecaster was patient-specific and the average area under the curve (AUC) of the best forecaster across patients was 0.68. In 50\% of patients, circadian forecasters had the best performance. Critical slowing forecaster performed best in 19\% of patients. Combined forecaster achieved the best performance in 31\% of patients. The results of this study may help to advance the field of seizure forecasting and lead to the improved quality of life of people who suffer from epilepsy.},

  abstract = {The algorithm of C4.5 decision tree has the advantages of high classification accuracy, fast calculation speed and comprehensible classification rules, so it is widely used for medical data analysis. However, for imbalanced medical data, the classification accuracy of decision trees-based models is not ideal. Therefore, this paper proposes a cluster-based oversampling algorithm (KNSMOTE) combining Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and k-means algorithm. The sample classes clustered by k-means and the original sample classes are calculated to select the ‘‘safe samples” whose sample classes have not been changed. The ‘‘safe samples” are linearly interpolated to synthesize the new samples. The improved SMOTE sets the oversampling ratio according to the imbalance ratio of the original samples, which is used to synthesize the samples whose number is the same as that of the original samples. Compared with other oversampling algorithms on 8 UCI datasets, our algorithm has achieved significant advantages. Our algorithm was applied to the medical datasets, and the average values of the Sensitivity and Specificity indexes of the Random forest (RF) algorithm were 99.84\% and 99.56\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy involves brain abnormalities that may cause sudden seizures or other uncontrollable body activities. Epilepsy may have substantial impacts on the patient's quality of life, and its detection heavily relies on tedious and time-consuming manual curation by experienced clinicians, based on EEG signals. Most existing EEG-based seizure detection algorithms are patient-dependent and train a detection model for each patient. A new patient can only be monitored effectively after several episodes of epileptic seizures. This study investigates the patient-independent detection of seizure events using the open dataset CHB-MIT Scalp EEG. First, a novel feature extraction algorithm called MinMaxHist is proposed to measure the topological patterns of the EEG signals. Following this, MinMaxHist and several other feature extraction algorithms are applied to parameterize the EEG signals. Next, a comprehensive series of feature screening and classification optimization experiments are conducted, and finally, an optimized EEG-based seizure detection model is presented that can achieve overall values for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Kappa of 0.8627, 0.8032, 0.9222, 0.7504 and 0.7254, respectively, with only 30 features. The classification accuracy of the method with MinMaxHist features was 0.0464 higher than that without MinMaxHist features. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithm achieved higher accuracy and sensitivity, as shown in the experimental results.},

  abstract = {The Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants have shown promising performances in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs’ large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling highdimensional sequential data with RNN architectures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling highdimensional sequential data.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder of the brain, which involves recurrent seizures. An encephalogram (EEG) is a gold standard method in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, the standard EEG recording system is too obstructive to be used in daily life. Behind-the-ear EEG is an alternative approach to record EEG conveniently. Previous researchers applied machine learning to automatically detect seizures with EEG, but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to be identified. Furthermore, the extremely small proportion of ictal events in the long-term monitoring may cause the imbalance problem and, consequently, poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. In this study, we present an automatic seizure detection algorithm with a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained by unsupervised learning and evaluated it with behind-the-ear EEG. Methods: We recorded behind-the-ear EEGs from 12 patients who have various types of epilepsy. Data were reviewed separately by two epileptologists, who determined the onsets and ends of seizures. First, we conducted unsupervised learning with the normal records for the GAN to learn the representation of normal states. Second, we performed automatic seizure detection with the trained GAN as an anomaly detector. Last, we combined the Gram matrix with other anomaly losses to improve detection performance. Results: The proposed approach achieved detection performance with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.939 and sensitivity of 96.3\% with a false alarm rate of 0.14 per hour in the test dataset. In addition, we confirmed distinguishability with the distribution of the anomaly scores in terms of EEG frequency bands. Conclusions: It is expected that the proposed anomaly detection via GAN with the behind-the-ear EEG can be effectively used for long-term seizure monitoring in daily life.},

  abstract = {Reliable epileptic seizure prediction is significantly important in improving the life of patients and enhancing the therapy effect. In this paper, a novel seizure prediction algorithm is proposed employing the tensor decomposition on long-term intracranial EEG recordings. The modified Stockwell transform (MST) is conducted on the segmented EEG signals to transform into two-dimensional instantaneous power spectra. Then, the third-order tensor representation of the multi-channel EEG signals are structured with the models of time, frequency and space. Tucker decomposition, one valid tensor decomposition method, is applied to obtain the principal components of the EEG tensors and the smaller core tensors after decomposition are extracted as features of interictal EEG and preictal EEG. After that, the classification of preictal and interictal data is achieved by feeding the features into Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) classifier. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out on the Freiburg EEG database and a sensitivity of 88.49\% for the seizure occurrence period of 30 min, meanwhile, a sensitivity of 97.62\% for the seizure occurrence period of 50 min are yielded with a false alarm rate of 0. 25/h. The results show that this algorithm based on tensor analysis has notable performance for seizure prediction.},
